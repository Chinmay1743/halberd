TODO
====

The following is a list of pending items:

- Review Halberd.cluster.analysis

- Test different clustering algorithms: fuzzy clustering is implemented in
  Matlab, k-means clustering is available in Scipy.  These algorithms should be
  tried to see which one provides the best answers.

- Rewrite Halberd.clues.analysis' auxiliary functions as recursive functions
  and formally verify them (think of automated theorem proving as well).

- Take into account Python 2.4's improvements and determine whether to use them
  or not.

- Write a man page (perhaps in XML).

- Write a good user's guide.

- Improve API documentation.

- Test extensively and determine whether 'Development Status' should be raised
  to 'Production/Stable' in setup.py

- Release the program (securityfocus, freshmeat, reality tunnels and maybe
  notify the authors of hacking exposed).

- Implement SSL detection feature.

- Implement Proxy functionality or maybe modify some program like Paros or some
  other (preferably written in Python to take halberd's clues into account when
  reaching web servers).

- Implement read/write locks.

- Write user documentation.

- Write more test cases... much more!

- Replace RPC protocol by a more secure one.
