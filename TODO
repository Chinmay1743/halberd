=======
 To do
=======

The following is a list of things to be done in *halberd*:

    - Implement read/write locks.

    - Improve documentation in the code.

    - Write real documentation (following pythonic guidelines!).

    - Write more test cases... much more!

    - See if there's a way to pickle *tlslist.Session* so it can be stored to
      disk otherwise see if *m2crypto*'s sessions can be serialized and stored.  

    - Use logging module throughout the program from a singleton or borg
      pattern replacing all those small functions warn, error and info
      scattered through the code..

    - Test the distributed protocol. It may fail and in that case NTP should be
      the protocol to imitate because it solves some of the issues we'll have.

So if you want, you can feel free to contribute in those areas. Pick up
something and `mail me`_ the results.
