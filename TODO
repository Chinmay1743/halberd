=======
 To do
=======

The following is a list of things to be done in *halberd*:

    - Implement read/write locks.

    - Improve documentation in the code.

    - Write user documentation.

    - Write more test cases... much more!

    - Test the distributed protocol. It may fail and in that case NTP should be
      the protocol to imitate because it solves some of the issues we'll have.

So if you want, you can feel free to contribute in those areas. Pick up
something and `mail me`_ the results.
