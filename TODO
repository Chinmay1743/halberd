TODO
====

The following is a list of pending items:

- 'halberd.py' should be renamed to 'halberd' and 'hlbd' to 'Halberd'

- Review hlbd.cluster.analysis (maybe implement a different clustering
  algorithm, rewrite the auxiliary functions as recursive functions and
  formally verify them).

- Write a man page (perhaps in XML).

- Write a good user's guide.

- Improve API documentation.

- Release the program (securityfocus, freshmeat, reality tunnels and maybe
  notify the authors of hacking exposed).

- Implement SSL detection feature.

- Implement Proxy functionality or maybe modify some program like Paros or some
  other (preferably written in Python to take halberd's clues into account when
  reaching web servers).

- Implement read/write locks.

- Write user documentation.

- Write more test cases... much more!

- Replace RPC protocol by a more secure one.
