 To do
=======

The following is a list of things to be done in *halberd*:

    - Implement read/write locks.

    - Improve API documentation.

    - Write user documentation.

    - Write more test cases... much more!

    - Replace RPC protocol by a more secure one.

So if you want, you can feel free to contribute in those areas. Pick up
something and `mail me`_ the results.
