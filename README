halberd -- HTTP load balancer detector
======================================

"The halberd, a weapon based on the spear, was developed by combining the
merits of the spear and dagger-axe in the Yin and Shang period (1600-1100
B.C.). It can be used to hook-cut, peck and pierce the opponent making it a
more powerful weapon than the dagger-axe and spear."

Overview
--------

	Halberd is a tool for discovering and bypassing HTTP load balancers. It
is useful in testing load balancer configurations as well as auditing web
servers and web applications.


Installation
------------

	Installing halberd is a very simple task. It suffices to write::

	# python setup.py install

	Python version 2.3 or above is needed plus its threading and MD5 or
SHA1 modules.

	A configuration file is stored in a directory named .halberd hanging
from the user's $HOME (in UNIX variants), %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%. Its name is
halberd.cfg and it holds information relevant to halberd's behaviour when
acting as a distributed client or server. So if you're going to use halberd
that way you should change the values there.

Documentation
-------------

	Full API documentation can be found in doc/api. A user guide and a set
of slides are being written.


Getting started
---------------

	You could start by trying:

	halberd.py -v www.sourceforge.net
