================================================================================

"The halberd, a weapon based on the spear, was developed by combining the
merits of the spear and dagger-axe in the Yin and Shang period (1600-1100
B.C.). It can be used to hook-cut, peck and pierce the opponent making it a
more powerful weapon than the dagger-axe and spear."
