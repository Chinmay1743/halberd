halberd -- HTTP load balancer detector
======================================

    The halberd, a weapon based on the spear, was developed by combining the
    merits of the spear and dagger-axe in the Yin and Shang period (1600-1100
    B.C.). It can be used to hook-cut, peck and pierce the opponent making it a
    more powerful weapon than the dagger-axe and spear.
